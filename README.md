# Forestry

A settings manager for Linux distributions for users using window managers and not full desktop environments. 

## Motivation

I found I really enjoyed using tiling window managers after experimenting with XMonad, i3, and Qtile (XMonad being my current preference). The one thing I missed from a full desktop environment was a more centralized settings application. I decided to start on this project to help out with my daily computer usage and help organize some of my system configuration. The state of this repository will indicate if I actually managed to commit to completing this project.


## Archiecture

I want this project to be as software agnostic as possible (ex. power-profiles vs tlp) and make it easier to change system settings on the fly rather than editing a config file or opening several other software programs.
